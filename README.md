# Berytech Events Automation
 A web application that aims to interact with slack APIs with an objective to automate some tasks on slackworkspace like:
 * Invite users to slackworkspace.
 * Create usergroups directly in slackworkspace.
 
The application scope now is to create usergroups into workspace, this how it works?
 1. admin can upload an excel file composed mainly of :
    * user first-name
    * user last-name
    * user team-name
    * action needed to perform by admin.(add user, delete user)
 2. once the file uploaded, the application will create the usergroups(team-name) into slackworkspace.

The application will expand to automate all slack activity of bulk operations even interating with users from different platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Outlook
